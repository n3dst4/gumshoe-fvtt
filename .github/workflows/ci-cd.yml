    # annoyingly, reusable workflows have to be in .github/workflows, either of
    # the local repo or a shared repo. There's literally no way of referencing
    # a reusable workflow in another folder, maing it impossible to use shared
    # workflows in subfolders (i.e. subrepos like we have.) Symlinks do not
    # work (GH does not follow them) so we are left referencing the
    # shared-fvtt-bits repo like this. See this discussion:
